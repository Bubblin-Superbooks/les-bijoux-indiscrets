The Aga Narkis entertains your mother, and your governess is upon the watch in a balcony for your father's return: take, read, fear nothing. But even tho' the <em>Bijoux indiscrets</em> should be found behind your toilet, do you think it would be a matter of wonder? No, Zima, no; it is well known, that the <em>Sopha</em>, the <em>Tanzai</em>, and the <em>Confessions</em> have been under your pillow. Do you hesitate still? Know then, that Agla� has not disdained to set her hand to the work, which you blush to accept. "Agla�," say you, "the sober Agla�!"—The same.</p></div> </div>
